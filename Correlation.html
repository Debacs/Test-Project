<h1 class="page-title">Correlation</h1>
<p>
  <strong>Correlation</strong> is a bivariate analysis that measures the strength of association between two variables and the direction of the relationship.
</p> 

<p>In terms of the strength of relationship, the value of the correlation coefficient varies between +1 and -1. <br>
  <em>A value of ± 1 indicates a perfect degree of association between the two variables.</em>

  <h2>correlation coefficient</h2>
  <p>As the correlation coefficient value goes towards 0, the relationship between the two variables will be weaker.  The direction of the relationship is indicated by the sign of the coefficient; a + sign indicates a positive relationship and a <q>– sign</q> indicates a negative relationship. Usually, in statistics, we measure four types of correlations: 
    <code>Pearson correlation,</code> 
    Kendall rank correlation, Spearman correlation, and the Point-Biserial correlation.

  <em><b>Pearson r correlation:</b></em> 
</p>
Pearson r correlation is the most widely used correlation statistic to measure the degree of the relationship between linearly related variables. For example, in the stock market, if we want to measure how two stocks are related to each other, Pearson r correlation is used to measure the degree of relationship between the two. The point-biserial correlation is conducted with the Pearson correlation formula except that one of the variables is dichotomous. The following formula is used to calculate the Pearson r correlation:
